# Supabase Best Practices: A Comprehensive Guide

This document outlines best practices for developing with Supabase.

# Database
- Whenever interaction with the database is needed, always follow rules in @file ./Postgres.mdc
- Whenever a Model class uses an Enum, we should create a corresponding Enum in Postgres following the guidance at https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/enums
- Regardless of the Enum casing in Dart, Postgres enum names and values should all be lowercase.

# Edge Functions
- Whenever writing edge functions, always follow rules in @file ./Supabase-Edge-Functions.mdc
